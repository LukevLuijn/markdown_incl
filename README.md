# Markdown include

See test docs for examples.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukevLuijn/markdown_incl.git
cd markdown_incl/markdown_incl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Script

The included bash script helps with file names because the program takes absolute paths, recommended to make an alias for this script.

```bash
alias markdown_incl="bash ~/path/to/script/markdown_incl.sh $1 $2"
```

## Usage 

```bash
./markdown_incl -h 
```
